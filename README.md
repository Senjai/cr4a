== Working repository for the Crafting Rails 4 Applications Book

I tend to work along with the books I read for better retention, this is a great book written by Jose Valim on Rails internals and extensibility. 

He is also on the Rails Core team.

You can find the book at [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](http://pragprog.com/book/jvrails2/crafting-rails-4-applications)
